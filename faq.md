### Why real name policy?

We introduced this policy recently to make the moderation of Slack easier. Generally, we noticed that people behave nicely with the real name associated. This greatly reduced spam, shit posting, and trolling. This also greatly reduced the efforts put by admins in moderaton. 

People who indulge in breaking rules of Slack, may asked to provide verification: Twitter, LinkedIn, Github etc.
