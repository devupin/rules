# Rules and Guidelines

## Ground Rules for the D&H Slack

* We follow real name policy. Set your real name in Full Name field of profile and use the desired username in Display Name. Username can be anything, but keep it professional
* Display pic - either of: your own pic, slack default, animated faces or solid colors. Again, keep this professional. Please do not use random images, memes etc
* Please be respectful towards others and use your common sense
* No Shitposting/Memes/Trolling
* If a conversation is going Off-topic (OT), please take it to `#casual-talk` or another appropriate channel. Other participants may request you to do so too. Feel free to respectfully request others to move OT conversations to an appropriate channel
* Please refrain from political discussions (regional, national, international affairs and the like) on *any* channel! We're a tech slack, let's stick to it. 

## Public Channels and Topics
Currently, there are 52 channels with dedicated topics. Feel free to explore on your own! A small sampling:

* `#ama` for any on-going AMAs (Ask Me Anything)
* `#general` is for stuff that isn't in any other channel, its our #overflow :)
* `#mentorship` is for the D&H [Mentorship program](https://github.com/code-together/mentorship) and questions related to it
* `#jobs` for job postings *ONLY*, discussions on posting themselves in #careers
* `#careers` for discussions on job postings, workplace and career advice
* `#programming` for language-agnostic programming topics and discussions
* `#tools` for editors, compilers and other useful tools
* `#linux` for discussions on unix-like OSes
